An extraordinarily vivid watercolor, subject matter being an active crucible in an ominous-looking foundry located somewhere, perhaps only Petree's imagination. See scan. May have been done as a cover for a pulp horror magazine or pulp detective magazine; there are several rather apparent demonic facial images hidden in the intense artwork. Petree (1919-1997) was, in any case, a prolific American illustrative artist with significant contributions to both pulp magazines and comic strips in the 1940's and 1950's. His works were primarily in color, as inked strips and both oil and watercolor paintings. Petree's most memorable comic book credits were for the later comic versions of Sally the Sleuth, a pulp comic strip heroine created originally by Adolphe Barreaux in 1934 in Spicy Detective Stories, but his greatest recognition was earned by his pulp color work for the Queenie Starr series, also in Spicy Detective Stories. Other notable Petree work included The Lone Ranger (Dell/Western), Girl Friday (Trojan), the Sally the Sleuth pulp installment entitled Blonde Decoy (in this case for Private Detective Stories, August 1950), Wilma West: The Range Runs Red (Leading Western, September, 1950), a daily strip of the fifties, Nick Halliday, and a wide variety of other pulp and comic issues. He also produced an undetermined number of non-genre oil paintings. lartwll. Bookseller Inventory # 000912",

H.P. Lovecraft - The Complete Cthulhu Mythos Tales. B&N Decorative Leatherbound Edition, First Edition Thus, First Printing. Tipped in poster is John Coulthart's famous 2004 poster, \"Cthulhu Rising\". Introduction by S.T. Joshi. A stunning form of presentation of the all-separately-published stories in the Cthulhu Mythos of the peerless H.P. Lovecraft - called \"The Man Who Can Scare Stephen King\", and of whom King said, ¿I think it is beyond doubt that H. P. Lovecraft has yet to be surpassed as the twentieth century¿s greatest practitioner of the classic horror tale.¿ Lovecraft's innate sense of horror - he instilled his native, inescapable sense of dread in his fiction - is best, and most famously, embodied in the Cthulhu Mythos chain of stories. Octavo, black background leather boards with illustrations and decorations in green and gilt on both covers and spine; spine ribbed; All Edges Gilt; endpapers illustrated (also by Coulthart); satin page-marker ribbon; xiii + 593 pp.+ 1 pp. About the Author. An extraordinarily handsome - and dread-inducing itself - decorative edition, the equal of any in Barnes and Noble's series of such editions. New, and flawless. Removed from publisher's shrink wrap only for scanning and description here; that disassembled shrinkwrap with gold sticker and book's own rear sticker will accompany the book. See all scans. First Edition Thus, and First Printing. Note: because the poster is neatly folded and tipped-in, the image of that here is borrowed. Ships in a new, sturdy, protective box, of course; not a bag. LT9.
